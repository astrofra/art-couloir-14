# Hazmat

Chosen to incarnate the elite of the Soviet space conquest, the men and women of the space programme were supposed to take the USSR to the stars. However, victims of bureaucratic red tape, these cosmonauts were forced to carry out the interminable erection of the programme's infrastructure, which never got beyond the construction stage.

Known as ‘Hazmats’ and transformed into construction workers, they watched their dreams of reaching the stars crushed by the concrete walls and imposing pipes of a forever unfinished space complex.
