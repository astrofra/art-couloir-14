**Arzamas 16**

Designed as an enclave of Soviet military-scientific excellence, Arzamas-16 was the cornerstone of a highly classified defense program. The city was meant to centralize the most ambitious nuclear armament projects. Alas, an overwhelming obsession with secrecy tragically sealed its fate.

Over time, the central government, overwhelmed by its own shifting priorities and bureaucratic opacity, ultimately forgot about Arzamas-16â€™s very existence. The city became an anomaly in the Soviet landscape: a place designed to defend Russia, but erased from its collective memory by an excess of secrecy.
