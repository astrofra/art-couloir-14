**Arzamas 16**

Designed as an outpost of Soviet military-scientific excellence, Arzamas-16 was the cornerstone of a highly classified defense program. The city was meant to centralize the most ambitious nuclear armament projects. Alas, an overwhelming obsession with confidentiality tragically sealed its fate.

Over time, the central government, dominated by its own priorities and bureaucratic opacity, ended up forgetting that Arzamas-16 even existed. The city became an anomaly in the Soviet landscape: a place designed to defend Russia, but erased from its collective memory by an excess of secrecy.
