An old vintage photo with a grainy, low iso, scratched, polaroid, instant photo, Soviet-era aesthetic. The image captures a blurred, dreamlike view of an urban Soviet landscape from an elevated perspective. On the right side of the frame, the edge of a large, undulating concrete structure dominates, its surface curved and ribbed, likely part of a monumental Soviet building with an experimental design. The texture appears soft due to the blurred focus, giving it a surreal, almost fabric-like appearance.

In the background, the outline of a rectangular, red-brick apartment block is visible, characteristic of Khrushchyovka-style housing, with rows of small, evenly spaced windows. The building appears hazy, shrouded in a pale, bluish mist that covers much of the scene, enhancing the dreamlike quality. In the foreground, the tops of leafless, spindly trees can be seen, blending into the mist and adding to the desolate, quiet atmosphere.

A red light leak blemish is prominent on the right edge, likely from damage to the film or exposure issues, contributing to the aged, deteriorated feel of the photo. The color palette is dominated by cool tones of blue and purple, contrasted with the faint reddish tint from the light leak. The overall mood is ethereal and melancholic, capturing the sense of alienation and ambiguity typical of Soviet urban environments in the 1970s, where stark architecture and muted landscapes convey an eerie, almost otherworldly stillness.
