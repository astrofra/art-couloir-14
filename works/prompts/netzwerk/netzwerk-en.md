# Netzwerk

A pioneering innovation in East Germany, the Netzwerk materialized a utopian vision: connecting the USSR's scientific centers in a single technological symphony. Under Khrushchev's leadership, this network was meant to symbolize the forefront of Soviet modernity, surpassing the United States in the race for progress. But congress after congress, bureaucratic inertia and delusions of grandeur triumphed over planning.

Rational ambition gave way to anarchic proliferation: kilometers of cables choking walkways, massive conduits crowding corridors, and interconnection systems cluttering workspaces. Designed to streamline information flow and accelerate research, the network became an uncontrollable entity, obstructing even the movements of its own creators.
