An old vintage photo with a grainy, low iso, scratched, polaroid, instant photo, Soviet-era aesthetic. The scene is set on a quiet, dimly lit urban street at night, with the wet pavement reflecting the glow of streetlights. Mounted on the exterior wall of a building, an old CRT television is prominently displayed, its screen flickering with static and abstract white lines. The television, encased in a beige plastic shell, has a rounded, convex screen typical of Soviet electronics from the late 1970s to early 1980s. The casing is slightly weathered, showing signs of age, with dark streaks and stains from exposure to the elements.

The building wall is lined with large, vertical window panes, reflecting the hazy streetlights that illuminate the damp sidewalk. The street is narrow, bordered by low greenery and patches of wet asphalt, glistening under the artificial light. The distant glow from the streetlights creates a soft, blurred halo effect, casting long shadows that stretch across the road. Sparse traffic is visible, with a few parked cars lining the curb, their silhouettes softened by the foggy, humid air.

The atmosphere is eerie and quiet, capturing a sense of abandonment or surveillance. The presence of the television, seemingly out of place on the exterior wall, suggests a relic from a past era of public broadcasts or an improvised surveillance monitor left running despite the passage of time. The static on the screen adds to the unsettling, dystopian mood, hinting at broken communication or the lingering remnants of a once-bustling urban setting now lost to time. The overall image conveys a feeling of isolation and disconnection, evoking the forgotten corners of a Soviet city at night, where technology and decay intersect in a haunting, cinematic moment.
