# VEB Radiograf

Born under the Democratic Republic of Germany, the VEB Radiograf Combinat was built to incarnate the technological avant-garde, producing massive computers to support data processing needs. Designed to optimise research and administration, the poorly adapted infrastructure was weighed down by endless upgrades. The bulky machines piled up and their maintenance became increasingly complex.

Analog computing, adopted in opposition to Western methods, disturbed the whole system. Computer hallucinations appeared, the screens regularly displaying ghostly silhouettes and other elusive forms seemingly alive. These anomalies, along with cryptic and inscrutable messages, caused the downfall of an industry that had gone out of control.
