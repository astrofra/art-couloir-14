An old vintage photo with a grainy, low iso, scratched, polaroid, instant photo, Soviet-era aesthetic. The image depicts the interior of a dimly lit office or monitoring room, with a bulky CRT computer terminal in the foreground. The computer, with its simple design, gray plastic casing, and a blank bluish screen, exudes the utilitarian aesthetic of Soviet-era technology. The keyboard, attached to the base, features large, square keys with minimal labeling, reflecting functional design over comfort. Through the slightly grimy window, an enclosed courtyard is visible, surrounded by plain, white concrete walls with small, uniformly spaced grid-like windows. The grass in the courtyard is overgrown, adding a touch of neglect to the otherwise stark and sterile environment. The lighting is natural but muted, with overcast skies casting a pale, diffuse light. The scene conveys an atmosphere of isolation, practicality, and quiet surveillance, characteristic of mid-1970s Soviet institutions.
