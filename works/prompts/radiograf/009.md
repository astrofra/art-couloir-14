An old vintage photo with a grainy, low iso, scratched, polaroid, instant photo, Soviet-era aesthetic. The image depicts a Soviet-era CRT monitor, typical of a mid-1970s design with a thick, boxy frame made of dark, matte plastic. The screen displays a distorted and blurred X-ray or medical imaging scan, giving off a ghostly, greenish-blue phosphorescent glow commonly seen on old monochrome displays. The lighting reflects harshly off the glass screen, creating a bright, overexposed white spot near the top, typical of poorly lit, utilitarian office environments. The faint outline of a clinical or laboratory setting is vaguely visible in the background, suggesting this is part of a diagnostic or research apparatus. The overall mood is eerie and cold, with the technology appearing outdated and slightly malfunctioning.
