> VR installation to embark the visitor in an archive of (imaginary) lost+found documents.

This project aims to create an installation that blurs the lines between the physical and virtual worlds. By utilizing GAN technology (Midjourney) on photos from my personal collection, I have generated dozens of images that simulates a lost and rediscovered archive of a research center deep in the heart of the late 1970s USSR.

## Concept

- **Generated Images**: The images depict ghostly figures, and atypical buildings, inspired by the city known as "Arzamas-16".
- **Installation**: The installation will be both physical and virtual. Visitors will sit in a chair facing a desk with various documents and objects, including a CRT television.
- **Virtual Reality**: When the visitor puts on the VR headset, they are immersed in a space that mirrors the physical setup. The physical and virtual tables align perfectly, enhancing the immersive experience.
- **Enhanced Experience**: The virtual environment elevates the physical installation. The virtual television displays a series of documents and the generated photos projected on a giant screen in VR.
- **Soundscape**: Accompanying the visuals is a spatialized soundscape.
- **Image Themes**: The images are grouped by themes such as Arzamas-16, the phantom creature, the computer team, etc.

## Technical Details

- **Hardware**: 
  - PC
  - HTC Vive Pro VR headset

- **Software**: 
  - HARFANG 3D
  - Lua

## Installation Setup

1. **Physical Setup**:
    - A chair facing a desk with various documents and objects.
    - A CRT television placed on the desk.

2. **Virtual Setup**:
    - Develop a virtual environment that mirrors the physical setup using HARFANG 3D and Lua.
    - Align virtual objects with physical ones for a seamless experience.

## Themes and Imagery

The generated images are categorized into several themes:
- **Arzamas-16**: Depictions of the secretive Soviet city.
- **The Phantom Creature**: Eerie images of ghostly figures.
- **The Computer Team**: Photos of the team members and their equipment.

## Sound Design

- Develop a spatialized soundscape to accompany the visuals.
- Ensure the sound enhances the thematic elements of the installation
